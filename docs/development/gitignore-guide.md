# .gitignore Guide

This document explains the comprehensive `.gitignore` file used in the Erlang Rebar Config Parser project.

## Overview

The `.gitignore` file is organized into logical sections to handle different types of files that should not be tracked in version control. This ensures a clean repository and prevents accidental commits of sensitive or generated files.

## Sections Breakdown

### 1. Go Language Files

```gitignore
# Binaries for programs and plugins
*.exe
*.exe~
*.dll
*.so
*.dylib

# Test binaries and coverage
*.test
*.out
coverage.txt
coverage.html
*.cover
```

**Purpose**: Excludes Go build artifacts, test binaries, and coverage reports.

**Why**: These files are generated during build/test processes and should not be committed.

### 2. IDE and Editor Files

```gitignore
# JetBrains IDEs
.idea/
*.iml

# Visual Studio Code
.vscode/
*.code-workspace

# Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text
*.swp
*.swo
*~
```

**Purpose**: Prevents IDE-specific configuration files from being committed.

**Why**: These files are user-specific and can cause conflicts between developers using different editors.

### 3. Operating System Files

```gitignore
# macOS
.DS_Store
._*

# Windows
Thumbs.db
Desktop.ini

# Linux
.directory
.Trash-*
```

**Purpose**: Excludes OS-generated metadata files.

**Why**: These files are automatically created by operating systems and are not relevant to the project.

### 4. Documentation Build Files

```gitignore
# VitePress build output
docs/.vitepress/dist/
docs/.vitepress/cache/
docs/node_modules/

# Node.js dependencies
node_modules/
npm-debug.log*
```

**Purpose**: Excludes documentation build artifacts and Node.js dependencies.

**Why**: These are generated files that can be recreated from source and package.json.

### 5. Project-Specific Files

```gitignore
# Output files from examples/utilities
prettyprint
*.formatted.config
*.parsed.config

# Test configuration files
test_*.config
temp_*.config
```

**Purpose**: Excludes files generated by project tools and temporary test files.

**Why**: These are output files that shouldn't be tracked in version control.

### 6. Security and Sensitive Files

```gitignore
# Environment files
.env
.env.local

# API keys and secrets
secrets/
*.key
*.pem
```

**Purpose**: Prevents accidental commit of sensitive information.

**Why**: Security credentials should never be committed to version control.

### 7. Development and Testing

```gitignore
# Test artifacts
testdata/output/
test-results/
coverage/

# Profiling files
*.prof
*.pprof
```

**Purpose**: Excludes test outputs and profiling data.

**Why**: These are generated during development and testing processes.

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep It Organized

- Group related patterns together
- Use clear section headers
- Add comments explaining non-obvious patterns

### 2. Be Specific

```gitignore
# Good: Specific to project needs
*.formatted.config

# Avoid: Too broad
*.config
```

### 3. Consider Team Needs

- Include common IDE files used by team members
- Balance between too restrictive and too permissive
- Document any unusual patterns

### 4. Regular Maintenance

- Review and update as project evolves
- Remove obsolete patterns
- Add new patterns for new tools/workflows

## Common Patterns Explained

### Wildcards

```gitignore
*.log        # All files ending with .log
temp_*       # All files starting with temp_
*.test.*     # Files with .test. anywhere in name
```

### Directory Patterns

```gitignore
logs/        # Entire logs directory
/build       # build directory in root only
**/temp      # temp directory anywhere in project
```

### Negation

```gitignore
# Ignore all .config files
*.config

# But keep this specific one
!important.config
```

## Project-Specific Considerations

### Go Module Files

```gitignore
# Keep go.mod and go.sum
# Ignore go.work (workspace files are user-specific)
go.work
go.work.sum
```

### Documentation

```gitignore
# Ignore built documentation
docs/.vitepress/dist/

# Keep source documentation
# All .md files are tracked
```

### Examples and Tools

```gitignore
# Ignore compiled example binaries
prettyprint
configanalyzer

# Keep source code
# All .go files in examples/ are tracked
```

## Troubleshooting

### File Still Being Tracked

If a file is already tracked by Git, adding it to `.gitignore` won't stop tracking it:

```bash
# Remove from tracking but keep local file
git rm --cached filename

# Remove directory from tracking
git rm -r --cached directory/
```

### Check What's Being Ignored

```bash
# Check if a file would be ignored
git check-ignore -v filename

# List all ignored files
git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard
```

### Global vs Project .gitignore

- **Project .gitignore**: Shared with all contributors
- **Global .gitignore**: Personal preferences (IDE, OS files)

```bash
# Set global gitignore
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

## Validation

To ensure the `.gitignore` is working correctly:

1. **Build the project**: Verify build artifacts are ignored
2. **Run tests**: Check test outputs are ignored
3. **Generate documentation**: Confirm build files are ignored
4. **Check status**: `git status` should be clean after builds

## Contributing

When adding new patterns to `.gitignore`:

1. **Test the pattern**: Ensure it works as expected
2. **Document the reason**: Add comments explaining why
3. **Consider impact**: Avoid overly broad patterns
4. **Update this guide**: Keep documentation current

This comprehensive `.gitignore` ensures a clean repository while supporting various development workflows and tools used in the project.
